This document contains the instructions required to exactly reproduce the analysis I performed, from raw data to final results. 
It is in the form of pseudocode.


Step 1: take raw data, run ___ code version 1.1.1 with parameters a=1, b=2, c=3.
Step 2: run the software separately for each sample
Step 3: take column three of output.txt for each sample and that is the corresponding row in the output data set.
